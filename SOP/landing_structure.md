Problem statement h2 - What most companies get
Old way bullets (check 07/01 post) - 
* Burn cash, not leads (but do it anyway): Pour $15K-$75K into an expo only to play the world’s most expensive business card collection game—poor ROI tracking, lengthy lead qualification, just blind hope.
* The post-event grind: Watch your sales team lose 50+ hours of their lives to mind-numbing data entry and endless research instead of selling to hot prospects.
* Cold leads, colder follow-ups: Without a system, hot prospects cool down fast, and high-value conversations get buried in the chaos, never to be revisited.
With XPOIQ bullets - What it could look like
* ROI you can see (and celebrate): Track every dollar spent and every lead gained to know exactly which conversations drive your biggest wins. No guesswork, just results you can measure.
* Salespeople doing what they’re paid for: No more drowning in business cards or researching accounts—your team focuses on selling, not admin work.
* Squeeze every drop of value: Our systems and automations ensure you extract maximum results—every lead, every conversation, and every opportunity accounted for.
