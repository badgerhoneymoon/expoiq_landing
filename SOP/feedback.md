Ilya explanations:

- google analytics
- microsoft clarity (если прям с первого раза сможешь (у меня не получилось) --> google tag manager (и туда все пиксели)

- пиксели (если удастся без еботни google tag manager установить – то весь код в отдельные контенейры, чтобы на странице был только код tag manager):

- google pixel (точное название не помню)
- meta pixel (сделав business account у meta, плюс если разберешься с conversion api то вообще заебок будет)
- twitter pixel (в последнюю очередь)
- linkedin pixel

misc:

- google console (видеть по каким ключевым запросам могут находить)
- хуйня для анализа SEO (было б легче если сайт на вордпрессе был бы сделан, но похуй)
- протестировать скорость загрузки через pagespeed.web.dev (все должно быть зеленым)
- сделать плашку (на фото, сделать не таким уебанским и маленькой плашкой. так, compliance на будущее)

Section-by-Section Analysis
Header (Top Navigation Bar)

Critique:

    The current navigation labels like “Pricing” and “Features” are too company-centric and not engaging enough for visitors seeking specific outcomes.
    “Wall of Love” is unclear in its meaning, and clients visiting your website for B2B lead generation may find it irrelevant or even off-putting.

Advice and Solutions:

    Rename “Features” to something client-centric such as "Our Results" or "How We Deliver." This draws attention to what matters to the client: measurable outcomes.
    Rename “Wall of Love” to “Client Success Stories.” Clear language that immediately conveys the value will improve navigation and direct attention to the results.
    Overall, ensure the menu is responsive on all devices, but above all, make every label speak directly to client concerns and needs (AJTBD principle: clarity in client-centric language).

Hero Section (Main Banner)

Critique:

    The headline "Build Your Scalable LinkedIn Outreach in 5 Days" is decent but doesn't adequately speak to the emotional jobs your clients are hiring you to fulfill. It’s dry, and frankly, a little generic.
    The subheadline, while clearer, could better highlight outcomes. "Agency-level results" speaks more about you than about what your client truly desires: control, growth, and confidence in their system.

Advice and Solutions:

    Revised Headline: "Launch Your Scalable LinkedIn Outreach and Take Full Control in Just 5 Days." This touches on both the functional job (scalable outreach) and emotional job (control).
    Revised Subheadline: "Get the tools, expertise, and confidence to generate quality B2B leads—on your terms." This frames the emotional outcome (confidence) and functional benefit (lead generation).
    Visuals: The current visual imagery could be more contextually relevant. Consider using visuals that resonate with business owners seeing tangible results (e.g., dashboards showing LinkedIn lead performance). Tie every element of this section back to client aspirations and jobs—help them see their success.

Client Personas and Pain Points

Critique:

    The website lacks an explicit section addressing client personas or pain points. This is a significant gap. The best way to engage your visitors is to let them see themselves in your messaging, which is currently missing.

Advice and Solutions:

    Create a dedicated section where you introduce specific client personas. For example:
        Persona 1: "CMO at a Mid-Sized Tech Company: Needs efficient lead generation without relying on agencies."
        Persona 2: "Sales Director at a SaaS Startup: Requires a scalable system to qualify and close leads on LinkedIn."
    For each persona, list common pain points like "I'm tired of relying on agencies that overcharge and underdeliver," or "Our internal team lacks the expertise to manage LinkedIn outreach effectively."
    This section should include direct client quotes and emphasize emotional outcomes like confidence and independence.

The Old Way vs The TNG Way

Critique:

    While this section offers a solid comparison, it reads like a feature sheet. The emotional aspect is missing. Clients hire solutions that alleviate frustrations and offer better alternatives to their existing problems, and this comparison chart doesn’t go far enough in painting that picture.

Advice and Solutions:

    Add a client testimonial or quote next to each point in “The TNG Way” to show how others felt the benefits of working with you.
    Integrate emotion more explicitly into the benefits. For example, “Full in-house control with expert support” could be reframed as “Feel empowered with full control over your lead generation, without the stress of dependency on external teams.”
    Use visual storytelling here: an infographic showing the transformation from reliance to independence would make this comparison more compelling and easier to digest.
