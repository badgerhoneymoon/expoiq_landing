When creating new components, stick to our styles present in other components. You can check them in SOP/styles.md.
If we have more than 300 lines of code, I think it makes sense to consider separating some logical block into a different file in the same folder.
Organize the code into logical functions.
Use descriptive variable names.
Add comments to explain the code when necessary.
Use consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and components.
Use consistent spacing and indentation.
Use consistent quotes (single or double) throughout the code.
Use consistent line breaks (LF or CRLF) in the code.
Use add-comments.md prompt to add comments to the new code you are writing.
Never delete any comments when you are editing code.
